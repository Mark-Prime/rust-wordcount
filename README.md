# rust-wordcount
A simple rust program designed to count the words in a text document you give it and return the ones that occur most often.

## Accepts up to 2 arguments. 
 - input
   - This is the path to the text file you want parsed
 - return_count (optional)
   - This is how many you want returned back to you.
   - If nothing is input, or an invalid number is given, it will default to 10.
